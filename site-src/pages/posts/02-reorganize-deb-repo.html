The LXC-Web-Panel is growing! During the last month the project was heavly refactor thanks to important community contributions.

This refactor otherwise let me rethink the release cicle that the LWP should follow to be consider stable, to simplify
the installation and community test of the lwp package I decided to reorganize the debian repository on gh-pages.

The stable version of lwp is now inside ```deb http://claudyus.github.io/LXC-Web-Panel/ debian``` while the release candidate
version can be found inside the ```deb http://claudyus.github.io/LXC-Web-Panel/ debian-testing``` repo.

To add the new repo to your sistem you can use this for stable version:
```
$ wget -O - http://claudyus.github.io/LXC-Web-Panel/claudyus.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
$ echo "deb http://claudyus.github.io/LXC-Web-Panel/ debian" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/lwp.list
```

and this commands fot testing version:
```
$ wget -O - http://claudyus.github.io/LXC-Web-Panel/claudyus.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
$ echo "deb http://claudyus.github.io/LXC-Web-Panel/ debian-testing" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/lwp.list
```
